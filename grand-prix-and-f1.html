      <h2>Engine supply</h2>
      <p>
        Ferrari has always produced engines for its own Formula One cars, and has also supplied engines to other teams. Ferrari has previously supplied engines to Minardi (1991), Scuderia Italia (1992–1993), Sauber (1997–2005 with engines badged as 'Petronas', and 2010–present), Prost (2001, badged 'Acer'), Red Bull Racing (2006), Spyker (2007), Scuderia Toro Rosso (2007–2013, 2016–present), Force India (2008) and Marussia (2014–2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        When regulations changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines. Marussia, the only team that Cosworth supplied at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, starting in 2014. As of 2016, Ferrari supply the Haas F1 Team, Scuderia Toro Rosso and Sauber.[90]

      <h2>Relationship with governing body</h2>
      <p>
        Ferrari did not enter the first ever race of the championship, the 1950 British Grand Prix due to a dispute with the organisers over "start money". In the 1960s Ferrari withdrew from several races in 'strike' actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1987, Ferrari considered abandoning Formula One for the American IndyCar series. This threat was used as a bargaining tool with the FIA – Enzo Ferrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the technical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar project was shelved, although a car, the Ferrari 637 had already been constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2009, it had emerged that Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.[91]

      <h2>Team orders controversies</h2>
      <p>
        Team orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari's history.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix, the two Ferraris were leading with Gilles Villeneuve ahead of Didier Pironi. The team showed the 'slow' sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed, and expected that Pironi would follow, but the latter did not, and passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as betrayal by his team mate, and at one point had even refused to go onto the podium.[92] This feud is often considered to have been a contributory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, after having started from pole position and leading the first 70 laps, Rubens Barrichello was instructed to let Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher pass him, a move that proved to be unpopular among many Formula One fans and the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, the sport's governing body.[93][94] Following this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as McLaren's use of them at the 1997 European Grand Prix and at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, and Jordan Grand Prix's at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the 2003 Formula One season.[95][96][97]
      </p>
      <p>
        On lap 49 of the 2010 German Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso went past Felipe Massa for the race lead, after Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was 'faster than him'. This communication has widely been interpreted as a team order from Ferrari. Alonso won the race, with Massa finishing second and Sebastian Vettel taking the final place on the podium.[98] Ferrari were fined the maximum penalty available to the stewards, $100,000, for breach of regulations and for 'bringing the sport into disrepute' as per 'Article 151c' of the International Sporting Code. Ferrari said they would not contest the fine. The team were referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council, where the Council upheld the view of the stewards, but did not take any further action.[99][100]

      <h2>F1 team sponsorship</h2>
      <p>
        The Ferrari Formula One team was resistant to sponsorship for many years and it was not until 1977 that the cars began to feature the logo of the Fiat group (which had been the owners of the Ferrari company since 1969). Until the 1980s, the only other companies whose logos appeared on Ferrari's F1 cars were technical partners such as Magneti Marelli, Brembo and Agip.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1996 Philip Morris International withdrew its sponsorship agreement with McLaren after 22 years to become title sponsor of Ferrari. In September 2005 Ferrari signed an extension of the arrangement until 2011 at a time when advertising of tobacco sponsorship has become illegal in the European Union and other major teams have withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies – McLaren had ended its eight-year relationship with West. In reporting the deal, F1 Racing magazine judged it to be a 'black day' for the sport, putting non-tobacco funded teams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco. The magazine estimated that in the period between 2005 and 2011 Ferrari received $1 billion from the agreement. The last time Ferrari ran visible tobacco sponsorship on the car was in the 2007 Chinese Grand Prix, with barcodes and other subliminal markers afterwards. On 8 July 2011, it was announced that the 'Marlboro' section of its official team name had been removed from the British Grand Prix onwards, following complaints from sponsorship regulators. The team is now called 'Scuderia Ferrari'.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 10 September 2009, Ferrari announced that it would be sponsored by Santander from 2010 on a five-year contract. It is believed that Santander will pay around €40 million ($56.5 million, £35 million) per season to sponsor Ferrari. The contract was subsequently extended to end in late 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the deal with Acer, it is allowed to sell Ferrari-badged laptops. On the other hand, in early 2009 semiconductor chip maker AMD announced it had decided to drop its sponsorship of the team and is just waiting for its contract to expire after its former Vice President and Sales Executive (who was an avid fan of motorsports) had left the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 3 July 2014 Ferrari announced a two-year sponsorship agreement with the United States based Haas Automation tool company which will transfer into a powertrain deal in 2016 when the Haas F1 Team enters the sport.
      </p>
      <p>
        The companies currently sponsoring Scuderia Ferrari include Alfa Romeo, Philip Morris International, Santander, Shell, Hublot, TNT Energy Drink, Kaspersky Lab, América Móvil, Weichai Holding Group Co., Ltd., UPS and Ray-Ban.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official suppliers of Ferrari include Puma, Magneti Marelli, OMR, SKF, Iveco, NGK, Brembo, Öhlins, Eibach Springs, Mahle GmbH and Oakley, Inc.. Other suppliers include Bell Sports, Honeywell, OZ Group and Technogym.
